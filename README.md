# Reset a bot's nickname in all guilds

This code resets a bot's nickname in all the guilds it is in, with a delay of 2 seconds between each guild to prevent rate limiting.

## Convert a .txt list of tokens into token.js file to easily run this code for many tokens

This code will take tokens from a .txt and replace the word `token` in the index.js file with each token from the list, saving it to it's own token.js file (token1.js, token2.js, token3.js, and so on) to remove the manual labor of it.
